## Start new React project

The best idea to start new React project is to use **create-react-app** that automatically generates project's structure with all required packages. In order to do so type below-mentioned commands into the Terminal window:

```$
npx create-react-app <react_app_name>
```

Having the project structure created validate it by running sample application:

```$
cd <react_app_name>
npm start
```
